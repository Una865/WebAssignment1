# WebAssignment1
E-commerce website

This website's possibilities:
 
 1.Users (both suppliers and customers) should be able to register and sign in securely.<br />
2. Sellers can place items in a system by entering item details (name, description, quantity, price per item, etc.) under specific categories (books, films, etc). <br />
3. Customers must have an adequate search mechanism for easy and quick access to particular products (e.g., filtering based on suppliers, price range, and reviews/star ratings). <br />
4. There will be a shopping cart so that customers can add a specific number of items and check out. For this assignment, you dont need to implement the checkout process. <br />
5. Customers should be able to view their past orders. <br />
6. Once the order has been placed, you can send a dummy date and time to customers and send a notification one hour before the delivery of the item (on a browser)<br />
7. Customers and suppliers should be able to update their details, such as addresses. <br />
8. You need to show strategic data and graphs for administrators and suppliers about the popular items in each category and age group (keep this simple!).<br />
9. There will be a feedback mechanism (descriptive reviews and star ratings) so that customers can give feedback on the product or service they have purchased.
