# WebAssignment1
E-commerce website

This website's possibilities:
 
 1.Users (both suppliers and customers) should be able to register and sign in securely.
2. Sellers can place items in a system by entering item details (name, description, quantity, price per item, etc.) under specific categories (books, films, etc). 
3. Customers must have an adequate search mechanism for easy and quick access to particular products (e.g., filtering based on suppliers, price range, and reviews/star ratings).
4. There will be a shopping cart so that customers can add a specific number of items and check out. For this assignment, you dont need to implement the checkout process.
5. Customers should be able to view their past orders.
6. Once the order has been placed, you can send a dummy date and time to customers and send a notification one hour before the delivery of the item (on a browser)
7. Customers and suppliers should be able to update their details, such as addresses. 
8. You need to show strategic data and graphs for administrators and suppliers about the popular items in each category and age group (keep this simple!).
9. There will be a feedback mechanism (descriptive reviews and star ratings) so that customers can give feedback on the product or service they have purchased.
